          <div>We know energy as what is used to create eletricity that powers our homes or what flows through the power lines but it's so much more! Energy is the building blocks of technology and research. Energy is created in many ways and it has many forms; Heat Energy, Electrical Energy, Mechanical Energy, Nuclear Energy, and the list goes on, but most energy you are familiar with is electrical energy, most types of are converted to this. Power generation, just like us, is messy, it hurts our environment but some forms of creating energy aren't as harmful. An example of this is nuclear fission, this is a type of powor generation that uses the splitting of atoms to make intense heat. The heat is then cooled rapidly causing steam, from there the steam is then turned into electricity. Here is an example of how fission works.</div>

          <div>As you know 'fission' is what nuclear power plants use to create energy but there are also is another type of nuclear power generation, this is called 'fusion'. The process of fusion is the colliding, or fusing of two light nuclei to create a larger nucleus, releasing roughly 10x the amount of energy as fission. Currently we have not yet harnessed the power of fusion but we may get there in the future.</div>
          <div>Not only is nuclear power Safer for the environment, but it also is the most efficient form of energy we have. According to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-power-most-reliable-energy-source-and-its-not-even-close">energy.gov</a> nuclear power has provided a fifth of all power to americans since the 1990s. It also says that is outputs 1.5 to 2 times the power than natural gas and coal. These plants also don't require as much maintenance as other types of power plants but they still need to be handled with care. April 26, 1986, the nuclear power plant chernobyl blew-up. This was due to a failure during a safety test.</div>
