          <div>You have probably heard about atomic weapons, the most widely known "Nuke" this was originaly called the atom bomb, but it has had many names after this. The first "nuke" was nicknamed "Little Boy" because it was one of 2 test bombs to be dropped on Japan. The first atomic bombs were made in 1945 under the Manhatten Project, "Fat Man" and "Little Boy".</div>

          <div>Here is the other bomb "Fat Man". As you probably know no nuclear warheads have been used for combat sense 1945, this is because of The International Atomic Energy Agency which was created in 1957 to encourage peaceful development of nuclear technology while providing international safeguards against nuclear misuse.</div>

          <div>Currently the worlds largest atomic bombs are in these areas, with the US and russia having the most. The thought that both governments have so much power at their finger tips is amazing! One more thing I want to talk about, Mad; Mad is a term used in the cold war and still is used today, it means Mutually Assured Destruction, the idea that if the United States or the Soviet Union attacked each other, the firing of thousands of nuclear weapons would mean both sides would lose. Simple example of the MAD Theory where neither will kill the other because they will be killed.</div>
